Scav-It! is a scavenger hunt mobile application that is currently designed specifically for play within specific exhibits at Balboa Park, San Diego, CA.

### App Functionality & How to Play Scav-It!

Start by creating your Hunter Handle Name and your name will be displayed at the top as you play.
You will be given clues for each object and your location will be displayed on the map. 
When you have located the clue, take a photo of it.
When capturing the photo, the map will display a red radius circle around the object. You must be within this circle when you take the photo.
If you are within the circle, you will see a pop-up in green stating you were successful.
If you are not within the red circle, a message will pop-up stating that you are too far away and need to try again closer.
If you can't find the item, you can go to the next clue.

This was a really fun project and really fun solving the clues.

BEST OF LUCK!
